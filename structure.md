# Government Structure

The Government Structure should have 3 parts:

- Executive: To Execute the Laws made by the Legislative Branch
- Judicial: To Interpret the Law
- Legislative: To Make the Law

## Executive

It has been known that in the United States, the President was given way too much power. We fix this by eliminating the president all together.

### Structure

The Executive Branch should have 2 members from each state. Their job is to take the layout of laws created by the Legislative branch, and implement them in the exact way they are written.

## Judicial

The Judicial Branch has been known to not be able to be forceful. Therefore, we fix this by forcing all Judicial rulings upon the Government. To keep this branch in check, we will allow the people to elect the Justices, and at any point in time, a vote can be called to replace a Justice, as long as a simple majority of the people agree.
